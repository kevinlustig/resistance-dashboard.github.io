How much should we worry about Trump and Republican majority government? Will Trump be unpredictable leader with hidden moderate tendencies and some policies that serve the nation? Or do we face creeping totalitarianism coupled with persecution of minorities and hard right ideological governance? Will things be great or shitty? We track estimates of his performance on several dimensions on the resistance dashboard. These point estimates (with associated confidence intervals) are highly multivariate in origin, based on neural network and advanced natural language processing on an substantial data store; current values are show on the dials and graphed since election day 11/8/2016.  We will also be producing estimates of change in certain policy areas, like health care, climate change, taxation, and the like.

Some changes proposed or implement by the Trump gang may require resistance. We will suggest strategic and tactical actions to help, including supporting efforts, organizations or politicians local or national. We will be looking for and compiling your input on resistance options.
